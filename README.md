# Bootcamp module 1 challenge

# Description
________________________

This Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means I need to modify the starter code.With Challenge I learn a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.
My motivation for this challenge - to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology.
In this Challenge, working to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible for marketing agency.
